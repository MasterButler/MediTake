1. Read on butterknife, its usage, and its advantages over other built in android functions (e.g. findViewById())
   *DO NOT FORGET TO USE Butterknife.bind(this) or else all fields annotated with BindView will be null.
2. Instead of using basic TextView/EditText input fields, we will be using TextInputLayout/EditText
3. ALWAYS remember to add ThemeUtil.onActivityCreateSetTheme(this) before setContentView(), it helps keep the layout consistent.
